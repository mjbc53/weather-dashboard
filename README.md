# # About The Project
## Description
This is a Weather Dash Board Web App

How it works. All you have to do is enter a city name you would like to see the
weather for and hit the search button. <br/>The page will then display the current
days forecast and a 5 day future forecast.

## Code Info
This page was build with HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap and a open Weather API. The
HTML is set up so it has Div layed out for each section of the page. <br/>The CSS is
simple and is used to display small changes to the page. Bootstrap was used to
layout the page and give the page style with a few changes from custom CSS.
<br/>The JS uses fetchs and API calls to get data for the page and display built
elements to the page.
